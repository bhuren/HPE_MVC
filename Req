•	Discussed Terraform training updates.
•	Azure Subscription and Azure DevOps access.
o	https://dev.azure.com/HPE-MVC/TCD_Public_Cloud
•	New Use-case for Azure, Azure DevOps and Terraform.

As discussed, please find the use-case details.
1.	Create one Repo in Azure DevOps (AzDO) and follow the file structure for creating the below resources.

resource_directory
            └───main.tf
            └───variables.tf
            └───output.tf
            └───providers.tf
            └───locals.tf
            └───var.tfvars

2.	Create Azure resources using Terraform. Use Parameterized template and all values from .tfvars file.
a.	1 Resource Group
b.	1 Virtual Network (dependent on resource group)
c.	2 Subnets (Use loop or dynamic to create multiple resource)
Note: Vnet will be dependent on resource group and Subnet dependent on Vnet and RG.

3.	As pre-requisite to store the terraform state file you need to use Azure Storage account and that can be created manually.
4.	Also Service Connection need to be created to authorize the pipeline and deploy resources to Azure.
5.	Create AzDO pipelines to deploy the resources in Step 2.
6.	Pipeline will have multiple stages that will cover terraform install, init, validate, plan and apply. 
Note: Use Microsoft-hosted Linux agents for this deployment.

Let me know, or ping in Group chat if you have any doubt or blockers.
